> Userland library for Nintendo Switch homebrew (and other potential purposes), written in pure Rust and some assembly bits

## Features

This library covers a lot of different modules, wrappers, etc. so some of them (essentially those which can be opt-in) are separated as optional features:

- `services`: Enables custom client-IPC service implementations, AKA the `nx::service` module

- `crypto`: Enables hw-accelerated cryptography support, AKA the `nx::crypto` module

- `smc`: Enables secure-monitor support, AKA the `nx::smc` module

- `gpu`: Enables graphics support, AKA the `nx::gpu` module (requires `services`)

- `fs`: Enables support for this library's FS implementation, aka the `nx::fs` module (requires `services`)

- `input`: Enables input support, AKA the `nx::input` module (requires `services`)

- `la`: Enables library applet support, AKA the `nx::la` module (requires `services`)

- `rand`: Enabled pseudo-RNG support, AKA the `nx::rand` module (requires `services`)

Note that most of these features/modules are just simplified and easy-to-use wrappers around IPC/raw system features, so not using them doesn't fully block those features (for instance, you could use services using IPC commands more directly without the `services` feature).

## TODO list

- Finish implementing all IPC/SF interfaces (+ their results):

  - Finish applet services

  - Finish fatal services

  - Finish fs services

  - Finish hid services

  - Finish ldr services

  - Add lm:get

  - Finish mii services

  - Finish nv servuces

  - Support HTC/TMA?

  - Finish pm services

  - Finish psc services

  - Finish psm services

  - Finish settings services

  - Finish spl services

  - Finish usb services

  - Finish vi services

  - Add other unimplemented services not mentioned above

- TIPC server support

- Extend hw-crypto support

- More FS interfaces:

  - PFS0

  - Romfs

  - NCA

- NRO Romfs support

- Finish implementing all SVCs

- Actual hw-rendering? (maybe as a separate lib like [deko3d](https://github.com/devkitPro/deko3d)?)

- Finish SMC support

- Finish waitable support

- Improve library applet support (specific implementations, etc.)

- Optimize IPC code to generate even better asm (like libnx or nnsdk)

- Finish documenting still-undocumented modules (`ipc`, `svc` and `service`)

- 32-bit support (see the corresponding branch)

- Console support

- Think about `std` support?
